OBD implements the [OmniBOLT](https://github.com/omnilaboratory/OmniBOLT-spec) specification, and it is an open source, off-chain decentralized platform, build upon BTC/OmniLayer network, implements basic HTLC payment, multi-currency atomic swap, and more off-chain contracts on the network of [smart assets enabled lightning channels](https://github.com/omnilaboratory/OmniBOLT-spec/blob/master/OmniBOLT-02-peer-protocol.md#omni-address).  

Clone, compile the source code and run the binary executable file, you will have a featured OmniBOLT deamon(OBD) to start the journey of lightning network.

# Background

Blockchain industry requires a much more flexible, extensible and cheaper smart assets circulation solution to solve the main chain scalability problem. Lightning network is a solid technology to this problem.  

We propose [OmniBOLT](https://github.com/omnilaboratory/OmniBOLT-spec) to enable lightning network to be smart asset aware. OBD is the golang implementation. Interested readers please go to the [spec repository](https://github.com/omnilaboratory/OmniBOLT-spec) for further understanding of advantages and how it works.  


# Dependency

[Omnicore 0.18](https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore) or later integrates the latest BTC core 0.18, which enables relative time locker used in RSM contracts and HTL contracts.

# Installation
The following instruction works for Ubuntu 14.04.4 LTS, golang 1.10 or later.

## step 1: fetch the source code

on your terminal:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/omnilaboratory/obd.git
```

or if you already set up your local git repo, you just need to fetch the latest version: 

```
$ git pull origin master
```

check if all updated:

```
$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/omnilaboratory/obd.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/omnilaboratory/obd.git (push)
```

## Step 2: 
#### option 1: Remote Omnicore node 
Use our remote OmniCore node. Go to `\config\conf.ini`, you will see:
```
[chainNode]
host=62.234.216.108:18332
user=omniwallet
pass=cB3]iL2@eZ1?cB2?
```
This is a tesing full node for our community to run/call/test omni commands remotely. The OmniBOLT daemon invokes Omni RPC commands from this node, if you use this configuration. It is the most conveniente way to get started.

**Notice:** Using remote omnicore causes a lower efficiency during creating RSMC and HTLC transactions, since there are rounds of remote calls to construct a raw omni transaction. Our test reports around 3 seconds in constructing totally 20+ omni raw transactions for an HTLC. So that in production enviroment, we suggest to use local omnicore full node:  

#### option 2: Local Omnicore node 
[Install OmniCore](https://github.com/OmniLayer/omnicore#installation) on your local machine. Omnicore requires a full BTC core node, which may take days to synchronize the whole BTC database to your local device. After finishing synchronization, you can run omni/BTC commands for experiments, such as constructing raw transactions or generating new addresses.

Edit the configure file: `\config\conf.ini`
```
[chainNode]
host=127.0.0.1:port
user=your user name
pass=your password
```

## Step 3: Compile and Run OmniBOLT Daemon

Wait till all data downloaded.

```
$ go build obdserver.go
```
which generates the executable binary file `obdserver` under the source code directory. 

if you want to generate exe file for windows platform, use this:
```
$ CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build obdserver.go
```
you will see an obdserver.exe file generated under the same directory.

### Startup  
Run:
```
$ ./obdserver 
```

By default, the configuration file `./config/conf.ini` will be loaded. 
To override this set the optional `--configFile <path>` program argument.

The terminal displays:
```
2019/08/23 23:05:15 rpcclient.go:23: &{62.234.216.108:18332 omniwallet cB3]iL2@eZ1?cB2?}
[GIN-debug] [WARNING] Running in "debug" mode. Switch to "release" mode in production.
 - using env:	export GIN_MODE=release
 - using code:	gin.SetMode(gin.ReleaseMode)

[GIN-debug] GET    /ws                       --> LightningOnOmni/routers.wsClientConnect (3 handlers)
```
Which tells us the daemon is running. We are going to use WebSocket online testing tools to test our lightning commands.


## Step 4: Test channel operations using GUI testing tool.

**NOTE: You should replace all of relevant data by the exact value that your own OBD generates for you**

OmniBOLT deamon(OBD) exposes WebSocket services for client interaction. For ease of use, we released GUI tool to help users to get started. Go to the [GUI tool repository](https://github.com/omnilaboratory/DebuggingTool) to download and try it.

<p align="center">
  <img width="500" alt="Debugging Tool Screenshot" src="https://github.com/omnilaboratory/DebuggingTool/blob/master/doc/img/image_screen.png">
</p>

If you dont want to deploy obd to start with, there is a list of testnet nodes in that repo that you can connect to.  

Another option is to use web socket test client for Chrome to do experiments. Install it from:
```
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/websocket-test-client/fgponpodhbmadfljofbimhhlengambbn?hl=en
```
Make sure your browser supports WebSocket, as displayed in this screenshot.

<p align="center">
  <img width="500" alt="Screenshot of Websocket online testing site" src="https://github.com/omnilaboratory/OmniBOLT-spec/blob/master/imgs/WebSocketTestSite.png">
</p>

Input `ws://127.0.0.1:60020/wstest`, press `Open`. If on the right text pannel, displays `OPENED`, then we are ready to send messeages to OBD.

The first message is to sign up as `Alice`. input the following request into the Request box, and press `SEND`:

```json
{
	"type":101
}
```

In the `Message Log` pannel, displays the response message from OBD:

*Return mnemonic words by hirarchecal deterministic wallet system.*

```json
{
    "type":101,
    "status":true,
    "from":"c2215a60-8b81-439f-8cb3-11ba51691076",
    "to":"c2215a60-8b81-439f-8cb3-11ba51691076",
    "result":"two ribbon knee leaf easy pottery hobby pony mule test bridge liar sand mirror decline gasp focus this park undo rough cricket portion ignore"
}
```

Then go to login as `Alice`. input the following message and press `SEND`:

*The mnemonic words is as a login name.*

```json
{
    "type":1,
    "data":{
        "mnemonic":"two ribbon knee leaf easy pottery hobby pony mule test bridge liar sand mirror decline gasp focus this park undo rough cricket portion ignore"
    }
}
```

In the `Message Log` pannel, displays the response message from OBD:

*A SHA256 string of mnemonic words as a user id.*

```json
{
    "type":1,
    "status":true,
    "from":"7da8d2441e0ad67040a274902f1965ee1a5c3fdd86f1ddc3280eda5230e006f2",
    "to":"all",
    "result":"7da8d2441e0ad67040a274902f1965ee1a5c3fdd86f1ddc3280eda5230e006f2 login"
}
```

It works.

## Step 5: Channel Operations on test site

For the convenience of brand new users, who are willing to learn the specification and source code, we built a test site for testing OBD commands and it is for testing only. The URL is:

```
ws://62.234.216.108:60020/ws
```
Open two chrom browsers, left is Alice and the right is Bob. Input URL and click `OPEN`, then both status will show `OPENED`.

# How to Contribute
OmniBOLT Daemon is MIT licensed open source software. Hopefully you can get started by going through the above steps, but Lightning network is not that easy to develop. Anyone is welcome to join us in this journey, and please be nice to each other, don't bring any illegal/private stuff, abuse or racial into our community.

Please submit issues to this repo or help us with those open ones.

Guidelines:

  * read the [OmniBOLT](https://github.com/omnilaboratory/OmniBOLT-spec) spec. If you have any question over there, raise issues in that repo.
  * ask questions or talk about things in Issues.
  * make branches and raise pull-request, even if working on the main repository.
  * don't copy/past any code from anywhere else in contribution, because we have limited resource to compare source codes to avoid legal issues. What we can do is to read your code, run tests of your newly developed modules and read your comments in your branch to see if it is solving a real problem. 
  * better running `go fmt` before commiting any code.
  * add test to any package you commit.
  * write/contribute light client testing tools, such as a HTML page supporting WebSocket, so that new programmers can have an intuitive experience to get started. That helps. We will release our tools for testing.
